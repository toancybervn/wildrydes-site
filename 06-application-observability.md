# Application Observability
In this module, you will integrate [Epsagon](https://epsagon.com) with your Stackery application.

## Instructions

### 1. Update the application 
In this step, we will use a more complex serverless application. To deploy it, switch to the `monitoring` branch of this repository:

```bash
cd ../wild-rydes-workshop/
git fetch
git checkout monitoring
cd ..
```

Now copy the content over to your local application:

```bash
rm -r stackery-wild-rydes/src
cp -a wild-rydes-workshop/src stackery-wild-rydes/src
```
```bash
cp wild-rydes-workshop/template.yaml stackery-wild-rydes/template.yaml
```

### 2. Integrate Epsagon
Next, let's integrate Epsagon to our application. To get started with Epsagon, take the following steps. A more detailed guide can be found at [the Epsagon documentation](https://docs.epsagon.com/docs/quickstart).

#### Create an Epsagon account
Click on the link below to bring you to the Epsagon signup page.

* [Create an Epsagon Account](https://dashboard.epsagon.com/signup)


#### Tell us a bit about yourself
Once you created your account, Epsagon will guide you through the integration. First, fill in some details:
![Epsagon about you](./images/06-epsagon-about-you.png)

#### Link Epsagon to your AWS account
Next, we will link Epsagon to our AWS account. To do so all that is required is deploying our CloudFormation stack to your account. A more detailed walkthrough of this step can be found [here](https://docs.epsagon.com/docs/aws-lambda-monitoring).

### Integrate Epsagon with Stackery
Next, you should land at the instrumentation step, which will let us trace our functions:

![Epsagon auto instrumentation](./images/06-epsagon-auto-instrumentation.png)

Since we will be using Stackery's integration to take care of the instrumentation for us, click on **"use our manual instrumentation guide"**.

Click the Stackery integration link:
![Epsagon stackery link](images/06-epsagon-stackery-link.png)

“Clicking here” will open your Stackery dashboard and place the Epsagon token for you!

The full documentation of this step can be found [here](https://docs.epsagon.com/docs/stackery).


### 3. Deploy updated Wild Rydes
You'll now deploy the updated *stackery-wild-rydes* stack:

```bash
stackery deploy --strategy local -e production --aws-profile <your-aws-profile-name>
```

This will again take a few minutes.

### 4. Start monitoring with Epsagon
Now that the integration is Done, you can click the "Monitor my application" in Epsagon to get to the Epsagon dashboard:
![Start monitoring with Epsagon](images/06-epsagon-start-monitoring.png)

Epsagon will automatically start monitoring your application. Order some unicorn rides, and let's see what's going on in Epsagon!


### 5. View your application
Epsagon will trace the invocations of your application. The first thing we will use it for is to get an understanding of how our application looks in real life.

Click on the [Architecture map](https://dashboard.epsagon.com/applications/stackery-wild-rydes-production/architecture) to have an overview of your application's architecture:
![Wild Rydes architecture](images/06-architecture.png)

Explore the different functions' stats and invocations in your account using the [Functions](https://dashboard.epsagon.com/functions) page:
