# Monitoring
In this module, we will set up monitoring for our application.

## Instructions
### 1. Configure alerts for your application
To be able to react to issues in your application, you can configure alerts for your application.

First, go to [Notification rules](https://dashboard.epsagon.com/alerts), and select [Create New](https://dashboard.epsagon.com/alerts/new).

Create an alert for the `stackery-wild-rydes-production` application:

After your alert was created, you can manage it in the [Notification rules](https://dashboard.epsagon.com/alerts) tab:

### 2. Trigger an error in the application
Trigger an alert in the application (like in the previous modules). You will receive an alert via the medium you configured:
